# :rocket: How to build?

1. Be sure to have flutter installed: https://flutter.dev/

2. Clone the project and go to root folder.

3. Exec `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

4. Be sure to have an emulator or an plugged cellphone with developer tools activated.

5. Done. To run in debug, exec `flutter run`. In release `flutter run --release`. To build apk, exec `flutter build apk`.

# :computer: Implementation

## Techs

1. Flutter Modular [https://github.com/Flutterando/modular] for Dependency Injection.
2. Mobx [https://pub.dev/packages/mobx] for state management and reactive.
3. Slidy [https://github.com/Flutterando/slidy] as tool. 
4. Dio [https://pub.dev/packages/dio] to HTTP requests.
5. Shared Preferences [https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences] to local storage.

I really like how Flutter Modular is structured (inspired in Angular) combined with the simplicity to deal with reactivity of Mobx. Slidy does'n count as implementation, but this tool helps a lot generating Pages, Modules, and etc.. Flutterando's community has been done a great job maintaining those techs.

## Architecture
I've been studying even more about how to build an software architecture maintainable and scalable. Clean Architecture 
Tenho estudado cada vez mais organização e estruturação de projeto de forma que seja mantível e escalável. Clean Architecture promotes the independent implementation of each layer of the application, facilitating project maintenance.

Obs.: I prefere to call `data` what is called `infra` in this image and called `infra` what is called `external`.
